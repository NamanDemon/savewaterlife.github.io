					<div>Simply put, water scarcity is either the lack of enough water or lack of access to safe water .</div>
					<div>It's hard for most of us to imagine that clean, safe water is not something that can be taken for granted. But, in the developing world, finding a reliable source of safe water is often time consuming and expensive. This is known as economic scarcity. </div>
					<div>In other areas, the lack of water is a more profound problem. There simply isn't enough. That is known as physical scarcity.</div>
					<div>The problem of water scarcity is a growing one. As more people put ever increasing demands on limited supplies, the cost and effort to build or even maintain access to water will increase. And water's importance to political and social stability will only grow with the crisis.

				  <h2 style="border: 3px; border-style: solid; border-color: blue; padding: 1em; color: #121111; font-size: 22px;"><strong>Water Scarcity In India</strong></h2><br>
				  <p style="color: #0D0202;">It is important to appreciate the fact that only 3 per cent of the world&rsquo;s water is fresh and roughly one-third of it is inaccessible. The rest is very unevenly distributed and the available supplies are increasingly contaminated with wastes and pollution from industry, agriculture and households. Indicators of water stress and scarcity are generally used to reflect the overall water availability in a country or a region. When the annual per capita of renewable fresh water in a country or a region falls below 1,700 cubic metres, it is held to be situation of water stress. If the availability is below 1,000 cubic metres, the situation is labelled as that of water scarcity. At the time of Independence, i.e., in 1947, the per capita availability of water in India was 6,008 cubic metres a year. It came down to 5,177 cubic metres a year in 1951 and to 1,820 cubic metres a year in 2001. According to midterm appraisal (MTA) of the 10th Plan, per capita availability of water is likely to fall down to 1,340 cubic metres in 2025 and 1,140 cubic metres in 2050.From as high as 18,417 cubic metres in the Brahmaputra valley, per capita water availability comes down to a low of 411 cubic metres in the east-flowing rivers between Pennar and Kanniyakumari. According to 2001 census figures, 77.9 per cent of India&rsquo;s population had access to safe drinking water. At 90.0 per cent, urban population was better placed than 73.2 per cent of rural population.</p>
					 <p style="color: #0D0202;">A survey conducted by Tata Institute of Social Science (TISS) showed 50 lakh households in Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Kanpur and Madurai are water deficient (see Table 16.5). World Health Organisation (WHO) specifies that minimum water requirement should be 100-200 litres per day. </p>
