								<p>
					<strong>Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface, and is vital for all known forms of life. On Earth, it is found mostly in oceans and other large water bodies, with 1.6% of water below ground in aquifers and 0.001% in the air as vapor, clouds (formed of solid and liquid water particles suspended in air), and precipitation. Oceans hold 97% of surface water, glaciers and polar ice caps 2.4%, and other land surface water such as rivers, lakes and ponds 0.6%. A very small amount of the Earth's water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products. Water on Earth moves continually through a cycle of evaporation or transpiration (evapotranspiration), precipitation, and runoff, usually reaching the sea. Over land, evaporation and transpiration contribute to the precipitation over land.</strong></p>

			  <p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FF0000; padding: 1em;"> As with all of Nature it is a symbiotic factor in a greater whole, and an element all life depends on.  As we degrade our soils, poison our land and remove the natural catchments for runoff through deforestation and removal of trees; as we fill in our waterways and natural filtering systems in the name of development and progress; as we dam up rivers destroying natural eco-systems, we completely upset the natural scheme of things that water needs to flow and filter clean water for us all. </p>

			<div><p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FF0000; padding: 1em;">In our slumber we have assumed water will always be there for us – Clean water to drink, waterways for recreation, healthy rivers and oceans to supply us with healthy fish, water to wash our cars, water to green our lawns and landscapes, water to bath and shower in, water to brush our teeth with, water for our swimming pools but actually water is present in a limited quantity.
				We can conserve, and consciousness is growing, but what about the new billions of people coming into the planet over the next few decades.  As water levels go down, the pollutants in it get stronger. All of life is interdependent and all of life needs water or....?</p></div>
